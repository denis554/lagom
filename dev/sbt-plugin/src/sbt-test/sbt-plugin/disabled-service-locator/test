# Structure of this test:
# =======================

# In part 1) we test that the service locator is not started if build setting `serviceLocatorEnabled` is set to false.
# While in part 2) we test that after executing the `runReloadAll` task the service locator is still not started, but 
# the application is reloaded (just as expected).
# Finally, in Part 3) we test that stopping the service locator has no observable effect since it wasn't running 
# in the first place.
