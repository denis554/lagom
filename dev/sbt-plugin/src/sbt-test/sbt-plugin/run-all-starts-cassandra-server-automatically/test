# Structure of this test:
# =======================

# In part 1) we test that the cassandra server is automatically started when executing the `runAll` 
# task. It takes time to start the cassandra server, the service locator, and the hello service itself, 
# which is why we are waiting 15 seconds before checking the assertion.
# In part 2) we call an endpoint that interacts with cassandra.

# Cassandra server tests

# Part 2 - call endpoint interacting with cassandra

# Part 3 - stop running service and Cassandra
